# Investigation on Density

## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on investigating various factors related to density. The core of the project is implemented in a Jupyter notebook, `error_analysis.ipynb`, which performs an analysis on error metrics, likely related to density calculations or model predictions involving density.

## Contents

- **`error_analysis.ipynb`**: The primary notebook where the analysis is conducted. It likely includes data preprocessing, error analysis, and visualizations related to the project.

## Dependencies

To run the Jupyter notebook, you will need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required libraries (these can be installed via `pip`):

  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
  ```

  Additional dependencies might be required depending on the specific contents of the notebook.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saiKasi0/Investigation-on-Density.git
   cd Investigation-on-Density
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Run the following command to install the required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt` if included):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter notebook**:

   Start Jupyter and open the `error_analysis.ipynb` file to explore the analysis:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook error_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Project Structure

- **Data**: Ensure that the relevant data files are placed in the appropriate directories before running the notebook.
- **Notebooks**: All analysis and results are stored in the `error_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
- **Results**: Visualizations, tables, and other outputs generated during the analysis can be viewed inside the notebook.

You can modify the README to include more specific details depending on the exact content of the notebook and any additional files or data used in the project.
